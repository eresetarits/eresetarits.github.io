My work is primarily experimental, testing theory and using theory to make (and test!) predictions in the wild. My systems range from microcosms to entire oceans. My study organisms are primarily microorganisms, such as algae and protists, and invertebrates, such as daphnia and bivalves. \r\n\r\n",
